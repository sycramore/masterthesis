Scripts for my master thesis "Graph state verification techniques" in Jens Eisert's research group
ELAIS-QST students : please look first into the graph state testing file. I added plenty of comments to make the
code more readable. If you have suggestions on how to improve it to make it prettier - I am open for feedback.
